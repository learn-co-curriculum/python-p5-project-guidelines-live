# [Live] Phase 5 Project Guidelines

It is time. Your final project for this course. This is the capstone project
that you'll be showing off to demonstrate all the things that you've learned so
far. This is awesome.

Before we dive into what your project is going to be about, we need to establish
some ground rules.

## Final Project

This is the time to dive into React libraries you've gotten interested in, or
play with APIs that would have taken too long to figure out during a shorter
project week. This is the time to make the app that you've always wanted but
never had, write up a bunch of custom CSS, and really put your skills on
display.

Because we're asking you to show off a specific set of skills, we have some
requirements. It should be obvious that one of the requirements is that you need
to use the things that you learned during this course. This isn't the time to
build a game with Unity or explore the MEAN stack or try and whip up a React
Native app. You've done a ton of learning already — it's time to apply all of
that knowledge.

## Project Requirements

You must meet the following Phase 5 Project Minimum Requirements:

- Implement Flask and SQLAlchemy in an application backend.
- Include a many to many relationship.
- Implement a minimum of 4 models.
- Implement a minimum of 5 client side routes using React router.
- Include full CRUD on at least 1 model, following REST conventions.
- Implement validations and error handling.
- Implement something new not taught in the curriculum. (Check in with your
  instructor to ensure the scope of your idea is appropriate.)
- Implement `useContext` or Redux.

** Please discuss with your instructor if you have any issues aligning these
requirements with your project.

## Helpful Tools

### Organization

- **Kanban/Scrum Board**: Because this will be the most complex project you've
made during this course, you'll need something to keep you organized. We
recommend Trello or a Github Project Board. Use this to track what you're doing
and what you need to work on. It's also a great idea to keep track of bugs that
you're not going to immediately fix.

- **Pomodoro Timer**: If you don't take breaks, you'll end up hurting your eyes,
getting RSI (repetitive strain injury) or burning yourself out. The Pomodoro
Timer method lets you put in solid chunks of work while also giving you regular
breaks. We like Marinara Timer, since it's nicely customizable.
